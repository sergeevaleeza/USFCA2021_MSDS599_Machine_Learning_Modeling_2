March - May 2022

This is combination of my school work on Machine Learning Modeling 2 class (MSDS 599 from USFCA) that I've taken during Spring 2022 semester.

This hands-on course offers an applied, practical introduction to machine learning. Students use open-source software to explore machine learning algorithms applied to real-world data sets. Applications involve both supervised and unsupervised learning in a variety of domains.
